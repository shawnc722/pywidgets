make GUI editor with list of sources - each source is a .py, grab classes from each source and display (names) in list. 
Choosing one prompts for a data source? Add dict to .py files with default params to support GUI viewer rather than names list?
on choice of widget, prompt for source with create jitstring button, button creates textbox fstring where clicking a source adds {source}
try/except the widget on preview click, and have export button to give resulting code with import/jitstring/pycmd/widget combo (no app or window)
so you can copy/paste into page script.


change sample_data.py to data_sources.py?
change sample to default - default_page.py, default_data.py
terminology:
page full of widgets, each widget takes data?
use `page.py` to refer to custom pages?

look into replacing JITstrings with functools.partial or others?
